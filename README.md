# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Understand data using statistics and visualizations.

1. Summary Statistics:
The dataset is first explored using descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles. This provides a quick numerical overview of each feature's central tendency and spread.

2. Histograms and Boxplots:
Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of numeric features, helping identify skewness or uniformity in the data. Boxplots complement this by highlighting the presence of outliers and showing feature spread and central values.

3. Pairplot and Correlation Matrix:
A Seaborn pairplot is used to visualize pairwise relationships between features, colored by species, to reveal patterns and class separability. The correlation matrix further quantifies the strength and direction of linear relationships between numeric variables.

4. Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies:
Interactive scatter plots using Plotly help in identifying trends between key features like petal length and width. Combined with boxplots, these visuals also assist in detecting unusual data points or anomalies in the dataset.

5. Feature-Level Inference:
Group-wise mean calculations by species provide insights into how different flower types vary across features. This supports preliminary conclusions about which features are most important for distinguishing between species.
